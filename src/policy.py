"""Risk-tier action policy (Smokey parity, ADR-010 analogue).

Classifies agent/awareness actions into risk tiers and decides when an action
needs explicit confirmation. Firehouse already gates *capabilities* via
per-user privileges (can/can't); this adds graduated *per-action* risk so the
agent can act freely on low-risk reads while outward/irreversible actions
(send email, control the home, shell, bulk delete) are confirmed.

Phase 0 ships the classifier + decision logic only. Enforcement is wired into
the agent tool dispatch in a later phase and is gated behind the
``FIREHOUSE_RISK_POLICY`` env flag (default off), so this module changes no
behavior on its own.

Pure standard-library — safe to import anywhere and unit-test without app deps.
